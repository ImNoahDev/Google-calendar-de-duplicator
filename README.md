## How it works:
The script automatically deletes any google calendar events that have the same name and occur at the same time from a year ago to a year from the date it was run.
This allows for deletion of duplicate google calendar events.

## How to use:
Copy the script from the deduplicator file and paste into google apps script.
run the script and set a trigger to run it daily.
